# Contributing to Audio Explorer

## Getting Started

To set up your development environment, run the following commands:
1. Fork and clone the Audio Explorer [repo](https://github.com/tracek/audio-explorer).
2. Move into the clone: `cd audio-explorer`.
3. Create Anaconda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

#### TODO

Currently Audio Explorer uploads every upload to my S3. We need a local mode that will allow anyone to easily experiment and develop the code.

## Coding Style

Please lint your code with `pylint` and `flake8`.
